# Project Overview

Our project consists of a robotic arm that can communicate with Pico4ML to pick up objects in a real world environment.

![Robot Arm Demo](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ayYpvePLw-IbuRR2myTyAWRRlo4vJI6G5xb7H_yLx3X6rAaIYGN2LaU74H9C2YbSLgo=w2400)
*Our demo day final product.*

Using a keyboard or joystick, it can be controlled manually by sending PWM signals to the servo motors. With the onboard camera, the arm can also autonomously identify and move towards the brightest point in the image.
